/*================================================================================================================*\
|  This file mimics cron jobs. You can create calls to executable php files with given time intervals.             |
|                                                                                                                  |
|  You can create a cron job by calling the Cron class with the following constructors:                            |
|    * (Required) Job name                                                                                         |
|    * (Required) Job script location                                                                              |
|    * (Required) Interval (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly or custom interval [2, "days"], [3, "weeks"], etc.)     |
|    * Execute time during the day in 24 hour format (at H:i:s format), cron job will be fired at this given time  |
|    * Activation date, the cron job won't be executed before this date.                                           |
|                                                                                                                  |
|  Note that these cron jobs will only be ran if the page is visited,                                              |
|  if no one visits the site the cron jobs will not be ran until the next visit.                                   |
|  Because of this you should not use this class for tasks that needs to be done reliably or at a specific time.   |
