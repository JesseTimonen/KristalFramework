# Kristal Framework

Kristal Framework is PHP based framework which aims to offer developers clean and simple MVC environment where they can develope their websites.
Kristal Framework was released to the public under MIT license, which allows people to use, modify and share this framework as they wish.



## Installing

1. Upload the files (which are inside KristalFramework folder) to a server.
2. Run composer install on your server to install dependencies from app/composer.json file.

After completing these steps you should now be able to access the built-in demo page by going to your server's URL.



## Troubleshooting

If you have issues with navigating to pages, go to .htaccess file and change redirect path at the routing controller section from relative path

    RewriteRule ^(.+)$ index.php [L]
    
to a full path

    RewriteRule ^(.+)$ https://www.example.com/index.php [L]

If you have issues during the installation you can also try to download the project from [here](https://www.jessetimonen.fi/kristal),
this version has all the installation steps already completed.

As this is a personal project, I don't have the capability to make sure everything works with every system out from the gate,
so if you experience any issues with the framework please let me know by sending an email to jesse.timonen@outlook.com
so I can try to help you fix the issue and improve the framework.
